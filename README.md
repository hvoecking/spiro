## Project Description

Inspired by the spirograph, Spiro is a digital visualization tool. The core concept involves tracing a graph of a single particle orbiting a black hole without any friction. This results in a chaotic system where slightly different starting positions yield entirely different patterns. It allows to save and load the exact starting conditions via a 128-bit seed, represented as a BIP39 mnemonic seed.

**Note**: The seeds generated by Spiro should not be used as Bitcoin seeds, and users should never enter their Bitcoin seed into this tool.

### Purpose

I wanted to build a visualization while I play music on my TV to avoid burn-in

---

## Features

- [x] **Save & Load**: BIP39 mnemonic seeds for saving and loading specific patterns.
- [x] **Themes**: Dark and light modes for better visibility.
  - [x] Automatically start in mode of OS.
- [ ] **Audio Capture**: Beat detection based on microphone or audio input, allowing pattern changes to be music-driven.
- [x] **Time-Based Changes**: Alternative to audio-based pattern changes.
  - [x] Track FPS to adjust to machine speed
- [x] **Entropy Options**: Switch between circles (96 bits) and shapes (128 bits).
- [x] **Rendering Options**: Switch between JS, WebAssembly and select 32 or 64 bits of floating point precision

### Todo

- [x] Play/Pause UI element
- [x] Prev and next seed
- [x] Menu Buttons in upper left
- [x] Stats display
- [x] Hide seed config behind eject button
- [x] Load & Save for Mnemonic via share button and URL
- [x] Zoom using wheel
- [ ] Add like/dislike buttons

### Bugs

- Keyboard input in binary seed not working properly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hvoecking/spiro.git
   ```

2. Install npm dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install external dependencies

- In order to convert small icons to base64 strings and embed them as style sheets the [`convert`](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) command from [ImageMagic](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) must be available as a shell command.

## Usage

1. Build the project

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing

1. Run jest tests

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. Run cypress tests

# Contribution Notes

## Staging Branch Strategy

We use a **staging** branch to integrate and test new features before merging into the **main** branch.

1. **Development**: Create branches from `staging` (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature`, `fix/my-bug-fix`).
2. **Merging to Staging**: Merge completed features into `staging` via pull requests for review.
3. **Continuous Integration**: CI runs on `staging` to ensure all tests pass before release.
4. **Release Process**: When merging to `staging`, `release-please` will create a PR to merge into `main`.
